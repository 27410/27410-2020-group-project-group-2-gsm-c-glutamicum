    "C. glutamicum is a gram-positive and facultative anaerobic bacterium. It was originally discovered in Japan in the 1950s in a screen for microorganisms producing and secreting L-glutamate in high amounts. Today, it is used in the industrial production of other amino acids such as L-arginine, L-lysine, and L-threonine as well as other chemical compounds such as vitamins. Although the putrescine biosynthesis pathway is not well-studied in C. glutamicum, it is a desirable host as it produces L-ornithine and tolerates putrescine better than E. coli.\n",

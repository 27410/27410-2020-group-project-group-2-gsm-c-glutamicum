# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 2 - Application of Genome Scale Modelling on C. glutamicum

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above ([Group Number] and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
Describe the overall aim of your project and what you have achieved.

The aim of this project is to 

genome-scale metabolic models (GSMs).

## Project overview
Describe how your project is organized ...

The project can be viewed in the Report.ipynb notebook. This notebook contains an introduction to the project, including a literature review of the chosen compound and the potential chassis, respectively. It also contains a selection and assessement of the existing GSMs using MEM, and the application of computer-aided cell factory engineering

 the GSM model and apply a number of strain design prediction algorithms

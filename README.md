> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
Describe the overall aim of your project and what you have achieved.

The aim of this project is to design a cell factory for the production of putrescine, a four-carbon compound that is used as a monomer in the 


The project considers the application of the following chassis: the gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum) and the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), which represent their respective advantages and disadvantages when applied as a cell factory.

In order to improve the genome-scale metabolic models, we have used computer-aided cell factory engineering in order to  genome-scale metabolic models (GSMs) 

## Project overview
Describe how your project is organized ...

The project can be viewed in the [Report.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/Report.ipynb) notebook. This notebook contains an introduction to the project including a literature review of the chosen compound and the potential chassis, respectively. It also contains a selection and assessement of the existing GSMs using MEMOTE, an open-source software containing a standardized set of metabolic model tests ([0.memote.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/0.memote.ipynb)).

In the project, the compound of interest is implemented in two potential chassis, i.e. C. glutamicum ([1.Cglutamicum_model.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/1.Cglutamicum_model.ipynb)) and E. coli ([2.Ecoli_model.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/2.Ecoli_model.ipynb)). Considering the selection and assessement of the existing GSMs, the proceeding work focused on the implementation of a heterologous pathway in the GSM model for E. coli.

The main content of the [Report.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/Report.ipynb) notebook concerns the application of computer-aided cell factory engineering to the GSM model:

* Calculation of the maximum theoretical yield ([3.Ecoli_theoretical_yield.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/3.Ecoli_theoretical_yield.ipynb)).

* Plotting of the phenotypic phase planes using aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively ([4.Ecoli_phenotypic_phase_plan.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/4.Ecoli_phenotypic_phase_plan.ipynb)).

* Simulation of batch cultivations using dynamic flux balance analysis ([5.Ecoli_dynamicFBA.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/5.Ecoli_dynamicFBA.ipynb)).

For the GSM model, there have also been applied a number of strain design prediction algorithms:

* Computing gene knockout strategies using the algorithm OptKnock ([6.Ecoli_gene_KO.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/6.Ecoli_gene_KO.ipynb)).

* Application of heterologous pathways prediction ([7.Ecoli_predicting_heterologous_pathways.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/7.Ecoli_predicting_heterologous_pathways.ipynb)).

Furthermore, the [Report.ipynb](https://github.com/27410/27410-2020-group-project-group-2-gsm-c-glutamicum/blob/main/Report.ipynb) notebook contains a discussion regarding the results of the applied computer-aided cell factory engineering, and a conclusion.
